# Mastodon Science Collective

Science Collective would be a fork of the Mastodon project which I hope to create and maintain to service the maverick science community.  The idea is that each maverick science thought leader would spin up their own Twitter clone dedicated to their particular project.  All of these instances can federate with one another to form into meta-communities, and the fork would be designed to specifically support these independent science communities.

The fork's primary features would include:

*Organizational Schema:* - Organization of discussion into a schema which is intended to distinguish the types of scientific discourse, reducing unnecessary conflict within particular topics and enhancing the capabilities of each community by supporting specific roles, patterns of behavior and discovery needs.

*Outreach Support* - Integration of social networking features necessary to promote complex scientific ideas across a variety of social networks.

*Modeling Support* - Support into the Mastodon instance for rendering Jupyter notebooks will enable the rendering of complex simulations in service of specific technical arguments.
