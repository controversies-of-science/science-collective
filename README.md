# Mastodon Science Collective

Science Collective would be a fork of the Mastodon project which I hope to create and maintain to service the maverick science community.  The idea is that each maverick science thought leader would spin up their own Twitter clone dedicated to their particular project.  All of these instances can federate with one another to form into meta-communities, and the fork would be designed to specifically support collaboration between these independent science communities.

The fork's primary features would include:

*Organizational Discourse Schema* - Organization of discussion into a schema which is intended to distinguish the types of scientific discourse, reducing unnecessary conflict within particular topics and enhancing the capabilities of each community by supporting specific roles, patterns of behavior and discovery needs.

*Outreach Support Features* - Integration of social networking features necessary to promote complex scientific ideas across a variety of social networks.

*Modeling Integration* - Support into the Mastodon instance for rendering Jupyter notebooks will enable the rendering of complex simulations in service of specific technical arguments.

*Prediction Market Tracking, Integration and Standardization* - Integration of the Auger blockchain for registering and betting on scientific predictions; will probably require the creation of prediction standards to label those predictions which avoid common, predictable mistakes.

*Bounty-Based Participation Reward Schema* - Karma-like system where ERC20 tokens are used to reward the site's moderation and early adopters.

*A Federated System for Annotating Scientific Papers* - All federated sites can activate annotations according to Mastodon instance, for the automated tagging of textual content.  They can also generate their own conceptual labels, which all of the various social networks vote upon.  Users and moderators would rate the usage of these wiki labels as annotations, with the hope that laypeople can use this tool to understand complex scientific papers.

*Controversy Card Annotations* - Rather than forcing users to choose between the wiki and controversy card formats, I'll provide both options.  The controversy card format would be more story-based, more rooted in passing on crucial sources, more graphical, and also more useful for sharing content to social media.

*Social Media Article Snapshot Tool* - A tool (possibly a chrome plugin?) for snapshotting science journalism quotes with the same color schema for font color and background, but with preferred font size, custom highlighting and framing options.  The tool would identify the original font, then reconstruct the quote (assuming that the font is accessible).  It would also present a variety of formats which would allow placement of an image from the article into the social media share.
